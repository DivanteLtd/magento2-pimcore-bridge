# Magento 2 - Pimcore Integration Module
This module is a part (1/2) of the Pimcore - Magento connector. 
It allows for integration between Magento 2 and Pimcore, including: 

* managing your Magento product information in Pimcore. 
* enriching product information by creating new attributes to suit your needs or by using existing ones. 
* publishing product information in Pimcore and exporting it to Magento with one click.
* creating categories, building them in a tree and exporting them easily to Magento.
* building up your media gallery, assigning assets and publishing it.

The second part of this module (Magento 2 - Pimcore Integration Module) is available at [DivanteLtd/pimcore-magento2-bridge](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/pimcore-magento2-bridge).

## <a name="big-picture"></a>Big Picture
![big_picture](README/integration_diagram.png)

## <a name="compatibility"></a>Compatibility

This module is compatible with Magento 2.2.x

## <a name="installation"></a>Installing/Getting started
###
- install with composer `composer require divante/module-magento-p2m-integration` or copy files to `<root>/app/code/Divante/PimcoreIntegration`
- `php bin/magento setup:upgrade`
- `php bin/magento module:enable Divante_PimcoreIntegration`
- configure the module in the Magento admin panel

## <a name="features"></a>Features
The module introduces a broad integration of basic entities available in Magento.

#### <a name="f1"></a>Product Integration
The following types of products are supported:
* simple product
* configurable product

#### <a name="f2"></a>Attributes Integration
The following types of attributes are supported:
* boolean (yes/no)
* text
* textarea
* select
* multiselect
* wysiwyg
* object

*Object* is a special type of attribute that emits an event which allows us to implement any complex attribute type via third  party services.

#### <a name="f3"></a>Categories integration
Import of categories from Pimcore, perhaps structured in a tree.

#### <a name="f4"></a>Assets integration
Keep your media gallery in Pimcore, assign them to a category or product, and publish.

#### <a name="f5"></a>Dynamic creation of attribute sets
The module detects if attributes on a product belong to an existing attribute set and possibly create a new one.

#### <a name="f6"></a>Multi Store support
The module supports multi store, therefore any entity can be updated only in a predefined store.

#### <a name="f7"></a>Translations
All data can be easily translated - including attributes' labels and options.

#### <a name="f8"></a>Unused options and attribute sets collector
Whenever the module detects that some options or attribute sets are not used, it will remove them to prevent storing unnecessary data in a database.

## <a name="configuration"></a>Configuration

The module configuration is available in the Magento Admin Panel. 
Go to Stores->Configuration->Pimcore Magento Bridge and then configure the following elements:

#### Basic configuration


![config1](README/config_1.png)

* **enable pimcore-magento bridge integration** - enable/disable the module's functionality
    * yes
    * no
* **logger handler**
    * stream
    * graylog (unavailable yet)
* **outdated queues** - enables removal of old entries on queue stack

#### Pimcore Integration
![config2](README/config_2.png)

* **Pimcore Api Key** - API key of integration configured in Pimcore
* **Pimcore Endpoint** - Pimcore API endpoint [domain]/webservice/rest
**IMPORTANT! "webservice/rest" is a mandatory part**
* **Instance Url** - instance URL of Magento which serves as communication identifier. In most cases, it is the same as the current instance's base URL.
* **Category Queue Processor Limit** - limit of how many category queue entities should be processed in one batch action.
* **Products Queue Processor Limit** - limit of how many product queue entities should be processed in one batch action.
* **Assets Queue Processor Limit** - limit of how many asset queue entities should be processed in one batch action.

#### Cron Settings
![config3](README/config_3.png)

* **Remove Unused Attribute Sets** - removes attribute sets that are not used by any product
* **Remove Unused Attribute Options** - removes options that are not used by any select/multiselect attribute type
* **Enable Products** - enables products which have at least one image, stock and price set.

##### Products
More types of products must be covered in integration, therefore we are aiming to implement bundle and grouped product types.

##### Tests
1. Refactorization of unit/integration test - some tests are broken at the moment due to regression and must be updated.
2. Write integration tests to cover the most important scenarios
